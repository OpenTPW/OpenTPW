# Patching STP / TPW for OpenTPW

In its initial state, the typical install of Sim Theme Park / Theme Park World is missing various features, including the following:

 - Music
 - "Gold Edition" / downloadable rides

These are quite easy to fix; in the future, there may be an automated solution available, however currently the steps to patch STP / TPW are as follows:

## Music

 1. Insert your STP / TPW disc
 2. Navigate to the "data" directory on the disc, and then into the "levels" directory.
 3. Within the "fantasy" folder, there should be another folder called "Music". Copy this folder into your STP / TPW install directory where the path matches up.
 3. Do this for each of the remaining subdirectories ("hallow", "jungle" and "space"). Music should then work both in standard STP / TPW, and within OpenTPW.

## Extra rides

 1. Download the file from [this link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/do9ke2d24713ypm/levels.rar).
 2. Extract the file to your STP / TPW install's data directory. You should now have all of the extra downloadable rides both within STP / TPW and OpenTPW.

# OpenTPW

OpenTPW is a re-implementation of [Sim Theme Park / Theme Park World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Park_World), requiring an installation the original game and its assets in order to run. OpenTPW aims to re-create the same experience as the original game. While OpenTPW was initially created as it is quite difficult to get Sim Theme Park to run on modern hardware and on a modern operating system, it also aims to somewhat re-introduce the original online aspect of the game - the servers of which have since been shut down.

## Requirements

- A decent graphics card & processor
